<h1>Invertebrates</h1>

<h2>What are invertebrates?</h2>

<p>
Invertebrates were the first animals to evolve, and they did so from single-celled microorganisms. Fossil<br> evidence of early invertebrates dates back to the late Precambrian, 600 million years ago. Since that time,<br> invertebrates have diversified into countless forms. A staggering <strong>97 percent of all species alive today</strong><br> are invertebrates. As a group, invertebrates are united more by what they lack (a backbone) than by<br> shared characteristics.</p>
