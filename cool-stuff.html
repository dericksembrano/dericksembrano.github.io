<h1>Cool Stuff</h1>
<h2>Cheese</h2>
<p><strong>Cheese</strong> is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some <strong>cheeses</strong> have molds on the rind or throughout. Most <strong>cheeses</strong> melt at cooking temperature.</p>
<h2>Bacon</h2>
<p><strong>Bacon</strong> is a meat product prepared from a pig and usually cured. It is first cured using large quantities of salt, either in a brine or in a dry packing; the result is fresh <strong>bacon</strong> (also known as green <strong>bacon</strong>). Fresh <strong>bacon</strong> may then be further dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be boiled or smoked. Fresh and dried <strong>bacon</strong> is typically cooked before eating. Boiled <strong>bacon</strong> is ready to eat, as is some smoked <strong>bacon</strong>, but may be cooked further before eating.</p>
<h2>Cars</h2>
<p>A <strong>car</strong> is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of the term specify that <strong>cars</strong> are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern <strong>car</strong>. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. <strong>Cars</strong> did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first <strong>cars</strong> that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. <strong>Cars</strong> were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other less-developed parts of the world.</p>
<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>A <strong>video game</strong> is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device. The word video in <strong>video</strong> game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but it now implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. The electronic systems used to play <strong>video games</strong> are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and <strong>video game consoles</strong>. These platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld devices. Specialized <strong>video games</strong> such as arcade games, while previously common, have gradually declined in use. <strong>Video games</strong> have gone on to become an art form and industry.</p>
<h2>Computers</h2>
<p>A <strong>computer</strong> is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
