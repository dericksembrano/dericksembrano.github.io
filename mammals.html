<h1>Mammals</h1>

<h2>What are mammals?</h2>

<p>Mammals are vertebrates that evolved from therapsid reptiles during the Jurassic Period, about 200<br> million years ago. The first mammals, known as morganucodontids, were nocturnal insect eaters that<br> resembled modern-day shrews. For the better part of 130 million years, mammals remained small and<br> lived in a world dominated by the dinosaurs. But around 65 million years ago, a drastic shift in climate<br> caused the extinction of more than two-thirds of the animal species on the planet, including the<br> dinosaurs. Today, mammals are remarkably varied, with some <strong>5,400 species</strong> occupying every continent<br> on the globe.</p>
