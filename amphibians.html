<h1>Amphibians</h1>

<h2>What are amphibians?</h2>

<p>Amphibians were the first vertebrates to transition from living in water to living on dry land (or at least<br> moist land). Despite their early colonization of terrestrial habitats, most lineages of amphibians have<br> never fully abandonned their ties with aquatic habitats. The first amphibians evolved about 370 million<br> years ago during the Devonian Period from ancestors that were lobe-finned fishes. Today, there are<br> between <strong>5,000 and 6,000 species</strong> of amphibians.</p>
