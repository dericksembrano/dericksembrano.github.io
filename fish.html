<h1>Fish</h1>

<h2>What are fish?</h2>

<p>Fishes were some of the the first vertebrates to evolve from invertebrate ancestors. The earliest known<br> fishes were the ostracoderms, a now-extinct group of jawless fishes that appeared in the Cambrian<br> Period, about 510 million years ago. Other early fish include the conodonts and the agnanthans (the<br> hagfish and the lamprey). Fishes later evolved jaws and diversified into a number of lineages including<br> cartilaginous fishes, ray-finned fishes, and lobe-finned fishes. There are an estimated <strong>25,000 species</strong> of<br> fishes alive today.</p>
