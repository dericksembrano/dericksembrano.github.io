<h1>All About Animals</h1>

<h2>What are animals?</h2>

<p><strong>Animals</strong> are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom <strong>Animalia</strong> (also<br> called <strong>Metazoa</strong>). Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop,<br> although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their lives.<br> Most animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently.<br> All animals must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.</p>
